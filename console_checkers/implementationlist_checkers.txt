Implementation List, Checkers:

Class of Pawn
    - Position
    - color/side
    - Movement (function, probably)
    - May add encapsulation later... 
    - Add constructor to place all the checkers pieces on the board (pre place when creating object)
    - CREATE A HEADER FILE FOR CLASS (Note: Done for readability purposes)
    
    Pawn constructor:
        - Take the position, and place each of the pieces in the correct locations and for each color(boolean value) *Checker board has 64 squares << 8x8 << 24 pieces total << 12 one side
        - Needs to know if any other objects are within 1 block horizontally or veritcally (not diagonally)

    Movement:
        - Exceptions (either try-catch extc) for an incorrect movement in the game (non-diagonally)
        -
