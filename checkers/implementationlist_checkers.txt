Implementation List, Checkers:  

Master:
    - Changed the file name to checkersmain, instead of consolecheckersmain. Decided against building it in a ASCII table through console,
    and will host this on the "web", with HTML and CSS elements.
  
    Class of Pawn
        - Position
        - color/side
        - Movement (function, probably)
        - May add encapsulation later... 
        - Add constructor to place all the checkers pieces on the board (pre place when creating object)
        - CREATE A HEADER FILE FOR CLASS (Note: Done for readability purposes)
        
        Pawn constructor:
            - the piece Obj is declared out of scope for the constructor. So there needs to be a seperate function, to create the board layout at least in numerical terms.
            - Constructor will declare the variables that are being dealt with for each object.

        Movement:
            - Exceptions (either try-catch extc) for an incorrect movement in the game (non-diagonally)
            - 
        
        Board Placement:
            - Taking the obj pieces and placing each one according to xpos, ypos, and color
            - seperate function in the pawn.cpp file
            - Using a for loop going through and taking the previous nums placement of x and y and adding too it based on what it has. If it is divisible by 0 (just a thought).
